Ð¡reate a slider.

According to the project requirements these are the control elements that need to be implemented:

- Arrows (to navigate through the slides in a loop. This means after slide #3, it will loop back to slide #1).
- Circles between the arrows (to indicate and navigate to the slide needed).
- Links above the slider (to directly navigate to the required slide).
